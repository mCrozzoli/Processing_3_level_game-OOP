Final assigment for Object Oriented Programming: a three level game with increasing difficulty

I programmed in Processing a 3 levels game with an increasing level of difficulty. Collision detention, enemies, collecting cassettes, lives, objects interacting with each other, and an octopus in the search of its treasure -so much potential! This is not a very good looking game, but so fun to create!
